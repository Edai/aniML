Being able to predict the future smash hits is of great
importance in decision making specially in the marketing.
In spite of the fact that there are many factors that influence
the success of an anime. It is not generally clear how
they influence, this project endeavors to determine these
factors using machine learning strategies by predicting a
score out of 10 based on the data provided by the famous
website MyAnimeList

This project imagined by ourselves is a regression predictive
modeling machine learning problem. By computing
multiple linear, nonlinear and ensemble algorithms on a
self-made dataset built from scratch, we finally predict
with a error margin of 5.7% the score of a anime
